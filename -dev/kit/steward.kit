        <p>Many of you will be very aware that in recent years St Andrewâ€™s had been unable to meet the monetary requirements of the Diocese.</p>

        <p>Through the generosity of the congregation and the hard work of our Vicar the situation has improved considerably, but we would like to keep it in a healthy state.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If you would like to make a regular contribution to St Andrew's then we can offer an Envelope scheme, or payments by Standing Order.</li>
          <li>If you do not want to make a formal commitment at this time, then please make use of the orange envelopes in Church if you are a UK Tax payer.</li>
        </ul>
